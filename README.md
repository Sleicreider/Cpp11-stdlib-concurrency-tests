C++ Testing stuff

Just playing around with C++ <thread> stuff.
Couldn't come up with an example, therefore took one of an C++ Interview, where you have to read a file 
and parallel count how often a word exists in the whole file.

Currently created a basic Producer Consumer with mutex locking and condition variables.
I'll want to change it to lockfree by adding slots per consumer and maybe optimize it even more.
This is just testing for me to get familiar with the std threading library.
